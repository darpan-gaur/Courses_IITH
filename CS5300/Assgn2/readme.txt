Make an input file which contains n, numOps, randLT and lambda as space seperated integers

// Discussed in class
Take randLT greater than 0.5, so NLQ can't get stuck when all thread perform dequeue.
Choose lambda to reduce or increase sleep time of threads.

Change the path/name of the input file in code as per your convinience.
Default path/name of input file is "inp-params.txt"

Compile :-  g++ CLQ1-CO21BTECH11004.cpp
Execute :- ./a.out

Compile :- g++ NLQ1-CO21BTECH11004.cpp
Execute :- ./a.out

Compile :- g++ CLQ2-CO21BTECH11004.cpp
Execute :- ./a.out

Output file :- NLQ1-out.txt, CLQ1-out.txt, CLQ2-out.txt
