Execute: ./BTO
Ouput: log file "BTOlog.txt" will be generated in the same directory.

Compile: g++ MVTO-CO21BTECH11004.cpp -o MVTO
Execute: ./MVTO
Ouput: log file "MVTOlog.txt" will be generated in the same directory.

Compile: g++ MVTO-gc-CO21BTECH11004.cpp -o MVTO-gc
Execute: ./MVTO-gc
Output: log file "MVTO-gcLog.txt" will be generated in the same directory.

For k-MVTO, k is harcoded to 5. Change it in the code as per your convenience.

Compile: g++ k-MVTO-CO21BTECH11004.cpp -o k-MVTO
Execute: ./k-MVTO
Output: log file "kMVTOlog.txt" will be generated in the same directory.
